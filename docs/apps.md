maintained but its key bindings have been ported over to an automation tool
called [HammerSpoon].

```shell
brew install hammerspoon
```

-   Download, unzip, and open the ShitIt Key Bindings for Hammerspoon
    https://github.com/peterklijn/hammerspoon-shiftit/raw/master/Spoons/ShiftIt.spoon.zip

-   Click on the Hammerspoon menubar icon and click on 'Open Config'. An init.lua file should now
    open in your editor of choice.

-   Paste the following configuration in the init.lua file, save it and close it.

    ```text
    hs.loadSpoon("ShiftIt")
    spoon.ShiftIt:bindHotkeys({})

## codewhisperer

Install [codewhisperer] (by AWS)

```shell
brew install --cask codewhisperer
```

[codewhisperer] (formerly known as `fig`) adds IDE-style autocomplete
to your terminal + some AI / LLM magic as well. Using `codewhisperer` requires
a free AWS builder account for personal use.

> NOTE:
>
> You must open the `CodeWhisperer` app at least once to set
> initial permissions and log in before you can use it.

-   Disable telemetry and shared data:
    ```shell
    cw settings telemetry.enabled false
    cw settings codeWhisperer.shareCodeWhispererContentWithAWS false
    ```

## httpie

Install [HTTPie]

```shell
pipx install httpie
```

[HTTPie] is a command-line HTTP client. The `http` & `https` commands allow for creating and
sending arbitrary HTTP requests. They use simple and natural syntax and provide formatted
and colorized output.

## trash-cli

Install [trash-cli]

```shell
brew install node
```

```shell
npm install --global trash-cli
```

In contrast to rm which is dangerous and permanently deletes files, this only moves them to the trash, which is much
safer and reversible.

```console
$ trash --help

  Usage
    $ trash <path|glob> [â€¦]

  Examples
    $ trash unicorn.png rainbow.png
    $ trash '*.png' '!unicorn.png'
```

## tmate

Install [tmate]

```shell
brew install tmate
```

Tmate is a fork of tmux. It provides an instant pairing solution - you can generate a secure, one-time
link to allow developers to SSH into your current terminal session.
